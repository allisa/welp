##Conflict Plan
As a team, create a Group Agreement as a markdown file to document the following:

What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
Talk it out or a possible dual to death. The person left standing is the winner, obviously.

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Ask direct questions. Talk to each other, talk through people's strengths and interests and how they want to contribute.

What is your process to resolve conflicts?
We will use stand-ups as an opportunity to voice issues. We plan on being open and communicative with each other through the entire project.

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?
After 15 minutes of death stares and no progess, we will seek outside guidance.


##Communication Plan
Add your communication plan to your Group Agreement. Some things to consider:

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
Slack

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?
Asking questions. Getting input on changes and ideas. Sitting near each other so everyone knows what is going on.

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
We all know each other enough by now that we feel comfortable around each other. We're all amazing people so it won't be an issue.
